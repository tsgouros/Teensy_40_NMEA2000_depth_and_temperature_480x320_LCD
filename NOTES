Compiles and appears to run, communicates successfully with an Airmar
DT800 depth/temperature transducer. It looks like there is some kind
of memory issue in the touchpad controller. It is commented out now
(see skp_lvgl.cpp) so not an issue for now, but should be looked at.

Depth is displayed correctly, verified a little bit with charts and
lead line, but the temperature is not. Not sure if that's a problem
with the Temperature() function, but it seems more likely to be
something else, since that hasn't been touched.

Procedure for turning a 320x320 png into a suitable background:

 1. Make a 320x320 image.

 2. Use the converter at https://lvgl.io/tools/imageconverter to
    create a C code file from your image. Use the 'RGB565' format.

 3. Add #include <avr/pgmspace.h> to the file, and insert the PROGMEM
    keyword into the declaration. It should look something like this:

    const PROGMEM LV_ATTRIBUTE_MEM_ALIGN LV_ATTRIBUTE_LARGE_CONST LV_ATTRIBUTE_IMAGE_DEPTHSCREEN uint8_t depthScreen_map[] = { ... }

    Without this step, the program will overflow memory.

 4. To keep the resulting file compatible with LVGL 7.11, the const
    declaration at the bottom should not have the .magic line, and
    should be spelled differently from the newest LVGL.

    const lv_img_dsc_t depthScreen = {
      .header.cf = LV_IMG_CF_TRUE_COLOR,
      .header.w = 320,
      .header.h = 320,
      .data_size = 102400 * 2,
      .data = depthScreen_map,
    };

Memory issue was uncovered. The Adafruit_FT6206 library requires the
invocation of the begin() method before touched() will work. Without
it, touched() causes a segfault, which gets the Teensy watchdog timer
involved causing the whole thing to reboot every eight seconds or so.

Also, discovered that extraneous files in the directory cause the
brain-dead Arduino compiler/IDE to fail silently and refuse to upload
to the device. So if you're wanting to save a little bit of code for
the future, either comment it out or save it somewhere else.
