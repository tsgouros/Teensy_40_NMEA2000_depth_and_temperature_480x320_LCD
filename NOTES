Compiles and appears to run, communicates successfully with an Airmar
DT800 depth/temperature transducer. It looks like there is some kind
of memory issue in the touchpad controller. It is commented out now
(see skp_lvgl.cpp) so not an issue for now, but should be looked at.

Depth is displayed correctly, verified a little bit with charts and
lead line, but the temperature is not. Not sure if that's a problem
with the Temperature() function, but it seems more likely to be
something else, since that hasn't been touched.
